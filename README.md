MorophDynamX and MorphoMechanX code used in "Symplastic guard cell connections buffer pressure fluctuations to promote stomatal function in grasses"

The following code was used in "Symplastic guard cell connections buffer pressure fluctuations to promote stomatal function in grasses" Wilson et. al. 2024. DOI:

The grass simulations were run on an Ubuntu 20.04 Virtual Machine (vmware.org) without use of an NVIDIA graphics card. However, the CUDA library and Thrust need to be installed for the models to compile. Instructions to install these can be found here.

The onion simulations were run on an Ubuntu 22.04 with an NVIDIA graphics card.

To install MorphoDynamX/MorphoMechanX for Ubuntu 20.04.
Install MorphoDynamX using the provided .deb package

```$ sudo dpkg -i MDX-2.0.2-1236-Ubuntu20.04-OMP-CellMaker-FemLib-Gmsh.deb```

If MorphoDynamX fails to install, the terminal should give you an indication of why. This is most likely due to a dependency issue. Some known dependencies that could be missing at this stage are:

g++
This can be installed using apt-get. Example,

```$ sudo apt-get install g++```

With MorphoDynamX installed, we now need to compile the source code for the models to run using MorphoMechanX.

- In the terminal, navigate to the directory 'code'. Then run the following,
- ```$ make clean```
- ```$ make```
- ```$ make run```

If an error occurs, most likely there are missing dependencies. Once again, the terminal should give an indication of what is missing. When setting up the Virtual Machine the following dependencies were missing and were installed:

- CUDA/Thrust (see above for installation)
- libqt5opengl5-dev
- libboost-all-dev
- libgsl-dev
- libtbb-dev
- libqtmultimedia5
- libqtmultimediawidgets5
- libqtmultimedia5-plugins
- qtmultimedia5-dev

For a full list of potential dependencies, please see the file dependencies.txt included in this repository.

The following Python packages need to be installed:
1. numpy
2. (optional) PIL (for making snapshots and gifs of the pressurized stoma meshes)
These can be installed using pip.

Example: ```$ pip install numpy```

To run the automated models:
Update globals.py to set your target output directory and change any model parameters. It is necessary to change the output directory to follow your own file structure.
- ```$ make clean```
- ```$ make```
- ```$ make run and MorphoDynamX should open.```
In MorphoDynamX, under /Process/Tools/Python/Python Script input fourcellsim.py or twocellsim.py for a four or two cell simulation respectively.
Press 'Step' (the play button) to run the simulation. Thisl should now run a simulation. To run the model with an alternate mesh, replace baseline.mdxm and the associated *.txt files with those in the sub-folders named 'barley-meshes', 'brachy-meshes' and 'bdmute-meshes'.
To create pictures/gif of the simulation.

In MorphoDynamX, under /Process/Tools/Python/Python Script input take-pics.py.
Press 'Step' (the play button) to create the pictures/gif. The output input/output directory is that specified in globals.py. (Also see limitations below)
To run the model using 3D Elements
In a terminal, navigate to the directory code-3d
- ```$ make clean```
- ```$ make```
- ```$ make run and MorphoDynamX should open.```
In MorphoDynamX, under /Process/Model select 01 FEM Wedges and press 'Step' (the play button) to run the simulation.
The version of MorphoDynamX that runs 3D elements, does not have the necessary add-on to calculate the geometric dimensions related to pore size. In order to obtain these measurements, the inflated mesh should be saved and opened in the version of MorphoDynamX in the directory 'code'.

There is only one mesh provided of 3D elements to be used for comparison purposes. The details of which are explained in the manuscript. The comparative mesh of 2D/membrane elements can be found in barley-meshes/smoothed-mesh-compare-3d.

## Current limitations

- Only one Python script can run with each launch of MorphoDynamX. Once one Python script has run and completed, MorphoDynamX needs to be closed and re-launched using the above steps.
- To create pictures/gifs:
  - The Python script take-pics.py works by taking screenshots within MorphoDynamX. Therefore, the overlayed text will not be in the same location for each setup. The user will need to edit take-pics.py to overlay text for their images.
  - Similarly, the heatmap is overlayed as well. If the heatmap for stress is changed from 0-75 MPa, heatmap.png will need to be replaced with a picture of the new legend.
 
## Alternative method to installation
To obtain a VMWare Virtual Machine that is preconfigured please contact Clinton (clinton.durney@jic.ac.uk) to obtain a copy. The file size is >25Gb.
